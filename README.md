WPF Expense Tracking Application (MVVM & ICommand Implementation)

The WPF Expense Tracking Application is a C#-based project that demonstrates the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and the use of ICommand for handling commands in WPF applications. This project is part of Exercise No. 6 for "ะะก" and focuses on data binding and command-based interactions.

Key Features:
MVVM Architecture: Implements the MVVM pattern for a structured and maintainable UI.
Data Binding: Uses INotifyPropertyChanged and ObservableCollection to ensure real-time UI updates when data changes.
Expense Tracking System: Displays a list of users with their expenses and allows switching to a detailed view of selected user expenses.
Command Handling: Utilizes the ICommand interface to manage user actions like navigation and data updates.

Project Components:
Expense Tracking Application:
Displays a list of people with expenses.
Implements a button to switch to a detailed view of a selected user's expenses.
Uses data binding to dynamically update UI elements.
Example Application with Commands:
Demonstrates how ICommand is used in WPF applications.

Two MVVM-Based Applications:
Showcases best practices in WPF development using the MVVM pattern.
This project enhances understanding of WPF development, data binding, and command handling in modern desktop applications.
